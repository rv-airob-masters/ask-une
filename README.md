### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **Model Configuration**: All agents use `gpt-4o-mini` for cost-effective and fast responses
- **AI-Powered Routing**: Router Agent analyzes queries to determine the best specialist, then directly executes the appropriate agent
- **Context Awareness**: Follow-up questions maintain conversation context with the same specialist agent
- **Rich Formatting**: Responses support **bold text**, proper line breaks, and structured formatting
- **CORS**: Backend is configured to allow all hosts for development
- **API Endpoints**: Frontend uses `/api/message/` for chat functionality
- **Session Management**: Sessions are automatically created and persisted in localStorage
- **Environment**: Make sure to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` before testing agent functionality

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
DEBUG=True
```

### Model Configuration

All agents are configured to use the `gpt-4o-mini` model for optimal performance and cost-effectiveness:

- **Router Agent**: `gpt-4o-mini` for analyzing queries and conversation context to determine routing
- **Course Advisor**: `gpt-4o-mini` with course lookup tools for academic planning
- **University Poet**: `gpt-4o-mini` optimized for creative haiku generation about campus life
- **Scheduling Assistant**: `gpt-4o-mini` with academic calendar tools for dates and schedules
- **Triage Agent**: `gpt-4o-mini` for handling general conversations and unclear requests

## üß† How the Router Agent System Works

The system uses a sophisticated two-step process for intelligent query routing:

### Step 1: Context-Aware Analysis
The **Router Agent** analyzes both the current query and conversation history:
- **Conversation Context**: Previous agent responses are formatted as `[Agent Name]: response text`
- **Follow-up Detection**: Identifies contextual indicators like "what about", "tell me more", pronouns
- **Domain Analysis**: Recognizes course-related, poetry, scheduling, or general queries

### Step 2: Direct Agent Execution
Once routing is determined, the system directly executes the appropriate specialist agent:
- **Clean History**: Selected agent receives conversation history without agent name prefixes
- **Natural Responses**: Agents respond naturally without `[Agent Name]:` prefixes
- **Correct Attribution**: Frontend displays the actual responding agent with proper icons/colors

### Example Flow
```
User: "What courses should I take for data science?"
‚Üí Router Agent analyzes: course-related query
‚Üí Router Agent decides: "Course Advisor"
‚Üí System executes: Course Advisor with clean conversation history
‚Üí Course Advisor responds: course recommendations
‚Üí Frontend displays: üìö Course Advisor

User: "What about electives?" (follow-up)
‚Üí Router Agent sees: [Course Advisor]: previous course discussion
‚Üí Router Agent decides: "Course Advisor" (context-aware follow-up)
‚Üí System executes: Course Advisor
‚Üí Course Advisor responds: elective recommendations
‚Üí Frontend displays: üìö Course Advisor
```

### Context-Aware Features
- **Follow-up Questions**: Automatically route to the same specialist agent
- **Topic Changes**: Override context when user explicitly changes topics
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintain context across multiple exchanges
- **Fallback Safety**: Keyword-based routing if Router Agent fails

### Adding New Agents

The system uses the Router Agent for intelligent routing. To add a new agent:

1. **Create the agent in `agents_integration.py`**:
   ```python
   new_agent = Agent(
       name="New Agent",
       instructions="Your agent instructions here",
       tools=[your_tools],  # Optional: add function tools
       model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Use the configured model
   )
   ```

2. **Update the Router Agent instructions** to include your new agent:
   ```python
   # In the router_agent instructions, add your agent to the routing rules:
   "- ANY question about [your domain] ‚Üí New Agent\n"

   # Add to the critical instruction list:
   "New Agent\n"

   # Add routing examples:
   "User: 'Example query for new agent' ‚Üí New Agent\n"
   ```

3. **Add agent to the mapping in `run_triage_and_handle()` function**:
   ```python
   # Update the agent_mapping dictionary
   agent_mapping = {
       "Course Advisor": course_advisor_agent,
       "University Poet": university_poet_agent,
       "Scheduling Assistant": scheduling_agent,
       "Triage Agent": triage_agent,
       "New Agent": new_agent  # Add this line
   }
   ```

4. **Update the parsing logic** (if needed):
   ```python
   # Add to the fallback content analysis in run_triage_and_handle()
   elif any(word in routing_decision.lower() for word in ['new', 'agent', 'keywords']):
       routing_decision = "New Agent"
   ```

5. **Update frontend agent list in `App.jsx`** (optional for visual indicators):
   ```javascript
   const agents = [
     // ... existing agents
     {
       name: "New Agent",
       icon: "üÜï",
       color: "#your_color",
       description: "Your agent description"
     }
   ];
   ```

5. **Add CSS styling in `App.css`** (optional for visual distinction):
   ```css
   .message-sender[data-agent="New Agent"]::before {
     content: "üÜï";
   }

   .message-sender[data-agent="New Agent"] {
     color: #your_color;
   }
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Wrong agent selected" or "Only Triage Agent showing"**
   - Check Router Agent debug logs: `DEBUG - Router Agent decision`
   - Verify OpenAI API key is set correctly
   - Look for parsing issues in `DEBUG - Router Agent cleaned decision`
   - Ensure Router Agent instructions are not being overridden

2. **"Agent responses have [Agent Name]: prefix"**
   - This indicates the clean conversation history isn't being used
   - Check that `agent_input_messages` (not `router_input_messages`) is used for agent execution
   - Verify the conversation history separation logic

3. **"Follow-up questions not maintaining context"**
   - Check that conversation history includes previous agent responses
   - Verify Router Agent sees `[Agent Name]: previous response` format in debug logs
   - Ensure follow-up indicators are being detected

4. **"Router Agent giving advice instead of agent names"**
   - Check Router Agent instructions emphasize "ONLY the agent name"
   - Verify parsing logic handles long responses and extracts agent names
   - Look for content analysis fallback in debug logs

5. **"Backend connection errors"**
   - Ensure Django server is running on port 8000
   - Check that virtual environment is activated
   - Verify all dependencies including OpenAI Agents SDK are installed

6. **"Frontend not updating"**
   - Check that Vite dev server is running
   - Verify hot module replacement is working
   - Clear browser cache if needed

### Debug Output Examples

**Successful Routing:**
```
DEBUG - Router Agent decision: 'Course Advisor'
DEBUG - Selected agent: Course Advisor
DEBUG - Running Course Advisor with clean conversation history
DEBUG - Final responding agent: Course Advisor
```

**Context-Aware Follow-up:**
```
DEBUG - Conversation context for Router Agent:
  1. user: What courses should I take for data science?
  2. assistant: [Course Advisor]: I recommend CS320 and STAT210...
  3. user: What about electives?
DEBUG - Router Agent decision: 'Course Advisor'
DEBUG - Selected agent: Course Advisor
```
